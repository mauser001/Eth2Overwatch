MIT - The Program and Code is free to use/modify/copy

### Disclaimer: 
I do not take any responsability for any damage/problems caused by the Eth2Overwatch tool. But I do my best to awoid them!

It is not possible to run more then one Eth1 (geth), Eth2 Beacon Chains or Eth2 Validators on the same machine as this programm kills all geth/beacon-chain/validator processes before starting new ones.

If find any spelling errors in the readme -> I write code - not books ;-)
